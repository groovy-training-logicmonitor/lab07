# Lab07: Streams

The goal of this laboratory exercise is to learn about the Java concept of Streams. Streams allow programmers to write code that processes Collections without being overly verbose.

## Step 1. Cloning this laboratory

First, we need to get this project onto your computer. We do this using the `git clone` command. In the Terminal app type the following command

```bash
git clone https://github.com/groovy-training-logicmonitor/lab07
```

This command creates a copy of all the files in this project onto your computer. Once this operation is complete, we can then move onto opening the project in IntelliJ. First, go to IntelliJ and go to the Welcome screen by either launching the app or closing all project windows. Next, select *Checkout from Version Control*. In the dropdown, select *GitHub* and select *Password* in the *Auth Type* drop down menu. Enter your login and password credentials using the GitHub user account you gave me at the beginning of this training. Once you have logged in, copy the above URL into the *Git Repository URL* field. Then click *Clone*. You should now have the project cloned to your computer and opened in IntelliJ. You can skip to **Step 3** if you used this alternative method.

**Alternative** If you wish, you can also clone this project using IntelliJ.

## Step 2. Opening the project in IntelliJ

Opening the project is simple. Select *Open* from the Welcome screen. Next, navigate to the location of the project on your computer and select the directory *lab02*. This should open the project in IntelliJ and you should be ready to run it.

## Step 3. Streams

### Exercise 1. Computing an average

In this exercise, you'll replace the code in **main.groovy** that uses several `for` loops to calculate the average of the odd integers from 1 to 100

### Exercise 2. Reading lines from a file

In this excercise, you'll replace the appropriate code in **main.groovy** that reads lines of a file and prints each to the screen

### Exercise 3. Reading lines from a file and filtering them

In this exercise, you'll replace the appropriate code in **main.groovy** that reads lines of a file and filters out all the words that do not have `uu` in them.

### Exercise 4. Reading lines from a file and converting each line to an integer

In this exercise, you'll replace the appropriate code in **main.groovy** that reads lines of a file, converts each line into an integer, then filters out the odd numbers, and computes the average of the even numbers

## Step 4. Committing the code

Commit it, I dare you! :-)
